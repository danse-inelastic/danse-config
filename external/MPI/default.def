# Revision 1.10  2004/07/02 02:42:34  cummings
# Added MPI_CPPDEFS and MPI_CPPLIBS macros, so that each target platform can
# specify a macro needed to enable the C++ interface to MPI and any extra
# libraries that must be included on the link line.  By default, these are empty.
#
# Revision 1.9  2001/12/27 00:02:07  cummings
# Check that we are not using the tau build target before adding the
# MPI library search path and MPI libraries to the external variables.
# If we are using Tau, the tau definitions file will handle this.
#
# Revision 1.8  2001/09/20 22:56:56  aivazis
# Added default values for the new symbols
#
# Revision 1.7  2001/08/18 03:42:56  cummings
# Add MPI_LIBPATH to EXTERNAL_LIBPATH.
#
# Revision 1.6  2001/06/30 23:51:39  aivazis
# Moved here the logic that disables mpi unless it is a build target.
# This is no longer the burden of client makefiles
#
# Revision 1.5  2000/05/17 23:37:26  aivazis
# Major update in the way defines and include paths are handled
#
# Revision 1.4  1999/07/01 21:23:27  aivazis
# Added a -DPARALLEL for parallel builds
#
# Revision 1.3  1999/06/20 00:08:18  aivazis
# Added preprocessor sysmbols WITH_MPI and WITH_PARALLEL_IO
#
# Revision 1.2  1999/06/09 01:39:33  mga
# Fixed typos and added header
#

#
# Read the local settigs
